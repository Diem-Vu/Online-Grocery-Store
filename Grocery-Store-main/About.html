    <p> Growing up, the owner of OFS (Organic Food Store) lived in a rural community. Everything on her family kitchen table came from the fields they planted and livestock they raised.
        Upon moving to the city of San Jose, CA for greater opportunities she noticed the lack of healthy organic foods. It was rare to find organic produce in the city and was usually not fresh and extremely overpriced.
        This led her to the idea of creating her own retailer chain that sells organic food. She was able to assemble a large group of local organic farms as suppliers.
        She believes that everyone has the right to access and afford fresh organic produce to live a happy and healthy lifestyle that she grew accustomed to.</p>
    <br>
    <p>  She also recognizes the busy life of people living in the city. Bustling with opportunities and life, she found an opportunity to extend her food retailer chain to include delivery services.
        To create an even easier accessibility to fresh organic produce, customers can choose and pay for their groceries online and it will be sent to their doorsteps.
        She charges $5 to orders over twenty pounds in order to encourage customers to order only the amount they need to reduce food waste and ensure the freshness of their food.
        Customers must have an account with their store to order online to allow potential customer customizations in the future for a more efficient ordering process. </p>
